%% Each author should be given as a separate \author command.
%%
%% Corresponding authors should have an e-mail given after the author
%% name as an \email command. Phone and fax numbers can be given
%% using \phone and \fax, respectively; this information is optional.
%%
%% The affiliation of authors is given after the authors; each
%% \affiliation command applies to all preceding authors not already
%% assigned an affiliation.
%%
%% The affiliation takes an option argument for the short name.  This
%% will typically be something like "University of Somewhere".
%%
%% The \altaffiliation macro should be used for new address, etc.
%% On the other hand, \alsoaffiliation is used on a per author basis
%% when authors are associated with multiple institutions.

\begin{tocentry}

Some journals require a graphical entry for the Table of Contents.
This should be laid out ``print ready'' so that the sizing of the
text is correct.

Inside the \texttt{tocentry} environment, the font used is Helvetica
8\,pt, as required by \emph{Journal of the American Chemical
Society}.

The surrounding frame is 9\,cm by 3.5\,cm, which is the maximum
permitted for  \emph{Journal of the American Chemical Society}
graphical table of content entries. The box will not resize if the
content is too big: instead it will overflow the edge of the box.

This box and the associated title will always be printed on a
separate page at the end of the document.

\begin{abstract}
 Conformational dynamics of biomolecules is an important to many biological processes such as cell signalling, drug mechanisms, enzyme activity and many others. Unbiased molecular dynamics simulation is an important tool to understand conformational dynamics but with the increasing scope of the molecule size and the length scales probed, the size of the data sets involved has grown considerably.  Learning the collective variables which describe the slow modes can be achieved by learning the Koopman operator eigenvectors. These eigenvectors can be learned using deep learning approach by maximizing the singular values of the Koopman matrix. However, given the increasing size of the data, training such a model, which usually requires many pass through's of the data (epochs) is an expensive exercise.  However, there exist many algorithms for estimating statistics by only one pass through of the data - these are known as `online` algorithms.  For deep learning estimators these algorithms are in active development and here we describe how well one such algorithms works when estimating Koopman eigenvectors.
